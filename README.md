# scanner-autocropper
Takes in multi-page PDF of 8x12in scans with (up to) 4 individual photos (separated by scanner bed whitespace), outputs 4 separate cropped images

Will add screenshots of GUI soon

For use with Epson v600
Scan 4 photos in ~ 5 seconds, add it to PDF, add 4 more photos, add it to pdf -- 
Approx 24 photos a minute
1440 photos scanned and automatically cropped for you an hour


Will add an EXIF date entry, so if you scan a photo album from August 1999, it will at least encode a month and year into every photo. That way, upon uploading to Google Photos, it will be sorted by date

Add background on why I created this
